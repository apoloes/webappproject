# webappproject
A web application that allows an airline to administrate flights and create airports

** SINCE THE API IS HOSTED BY UNC CS DEPARTMENT, THE APP ONLY WORKS ON-CAMPUS :( **
The website starts with a login screen for a Delta employee. The login button click makes an API request and if successful then the next page loads. The username and password that can be used for my project is yyz1928 (both username and password).
